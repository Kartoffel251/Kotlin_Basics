        Nested is a class created inside another class

        in Kotlin a nested class is by default static so its data members and member functions can be accessed without creating an object of the class

        nested classes can't access data member of outer classes

        Inner class is a class which has the keyword inner and is created inside another class

        can't be declared in interfaces or non-inner nested classes

        inner classes are able to use the outer class members even if it is private
